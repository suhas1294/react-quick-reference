POST_DETAILS_URL = http://localhost:8080/posts/12
POST_DETAILS_WITH_COMMENTS_URL = http://localhost:8080/posts/12/comments

Requirement:
    POST_DETAILS_URL shows details about a particular post, lets say component name is <PostDetail />
    Now, when we want to show comments of that post in same page, then we need to navigate to POST_DETAILS_WITH_COMMENTS_URL

How do we do that ?
1. provide a nested <Route> component in POST_DETAILS_URL page called "Load commments"
2. Write a nested route inside <PostDetail /> like :
    <Route path={`quotes/${params.quoteId}/comments`}>
        <Comments />
    </Route>
3. when clicked on 'Load comments' link, write a handler and make use of history object to programatically naviate to 'http://localhost:8080/posts/12/comments'
4. Now when user is navigated to 'POST_DETAILS_WITH_COMMENTS_URL', "Load Comments" should not be shown - This can be achieved by adding following code inside <PostDetail /> component as below:
  <Route path={`/quotes/${params.quoteId}`} exact>
      <div className='centered'>
          <Link className='btn--flat' to={`quotes/${params.quoteId / comments`}>
              Load Comments
          </Link>
      </div>
  </Route>
5. So that when user navigates to POST_DETAILS_WITH_COMMENTS_URL, "load comments" will disappear.
6. If main route is changes in app.js, then we need to change in nested route as well since its hardcoded.
To avoid this, we use UseRouteMatch .

<Route path={`${match.path}/comments`}>
    <Comments />
</Route>

<Route path={match.path} exact>
  <div className='centered'>
    <Link className='btn--flat' to={`${match.url}/comments`}>
      Load Comments
    </Link>
  </div>
</Route>

note: 
//   match.url : actaul url in browser : ex : localhost:8080/quotes/q2/comments
//   match.path : react code for url : ex : localhost:8080/quotes/:quoteId/comments
